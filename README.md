Chrome development of the [add-art][2] extension. Feel free to [fork][3] and contribute.

The extension is currently functional and on the Chrome Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/add-art/jplogjalofjlkendelkacpekloflkfeg). 

We'd love for you to help with this.

1. Work on an [issue](https://github.com/coreytegeler/add-art-chrome/issues)
2. Test. Then create an issue of your own
