Chrome development of [Steve Lambert][1]'s [Add-Art][2] plugin. Feel free to [fork][3] and contribute.

The Chrome version is currently just a popup interface that reads the Add-Art RSS feed to pull information and images for each show. It does not yet replace the ads with the art, which is rather important. This code is written in the original Add-Art plugin for Firefox, but needs to be ported here using Chrome's browser extension API. We'd love for you to help with this.
