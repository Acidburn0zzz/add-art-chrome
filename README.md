![REPLACED!](images/cover.gif)

Chrome development of [Steve Lambert][1]'s [Add-Art][2] plugin. Feel free to [fork][3] and contribute.

The extension is currently functional. It uses [this fork][4] of [uBlock][5] under the hood to identify ads. Then we replace them with art.

We'd love for you to help with this.

1. Work on an [issue](https://github.com/coreytegeler/add-art-chrome/issues)
2. Test. Then create an issue of your own
