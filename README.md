Chrome development of [Steve Lambert][1]'s [Add-Art][2] plugin. Feel free to [fork][3] and contribute.

The Chrome version is currently just a popup interface that reads the Add-Art RSS feed to pull information and images for each show. It does not yet replace the ads with the art, which is rather important.

The ad-replacing and art-adding code is written in the original [Add-Art plugin for Firefox][2], but needs to be ported here using [Chrome's browser extension API][4]. We'd love for you to help with this.
